# pomodoro-interval-timer

These files are part of my first project in Python, an interval timer, allowing you to chain several timers together. After problems with my PC, I salvaged them from Sublime Text Editor cache folder and recompiled from .pyc format. They lack comments and are unfinished, as I pivoted towards SQL. One day I will complete this, but I am currently focused solely on SQL.
